    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of reasons to make baked chicken tenders instead of breaking out your deep fryer:
      They require a lot less oil than their deep-fried counterparts, which makes them a lighter alternative.
      Plus, this oven-baked method is incredibly easy (not to mention it makes cleanup a breeze).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
