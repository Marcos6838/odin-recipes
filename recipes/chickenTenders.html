    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of reasons to make baked chicken tenders instead of breaking out your deep fryer:
      They require a lot less oil than their deep-fried counterparts, which makes them a lighter alternative.
      Plus, this oven-baked method is incredibly easy (not to mention it makes cleanup a breeze).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups panko bread crumbs</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>4 skinless,boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make Breading: Crack a whole egg into a shallo dish. In a zip-top bac, combine the bread
      crumbs, garlic powder, ionion powder, paprika, slat, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
